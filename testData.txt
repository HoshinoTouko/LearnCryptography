This has been a long project, and so many people have been kind enough to help make it come into being, I know I am going to miss some. A complete list can be found in the acknowledgments section of http://www.artofgamedesign.com , but I mention people here who really did more than their share. Nyra and Emma, the loves of my life, who always encouraged me, and put up with years of me staring into space and jotting little notes when I should have been, say, mowing the lawn, doing the dishes, or
putting out that fire in the backyard. My mother, Susanne Fahringer, who, when I was
twelve, understood somehow that Dungeons and Dragons was very, very important. My brother, Ben, who taught me how to play Thunder, a card game he invented in a dream when he was four years old. Jeff McGinley, for putting that whole ice cream cone in his mouth. And for putting up with me for
three decades. Reagan Heller, who worked with me for
countless hours in countless restau-rants, airplanes, and meeting rooms coming up with visualization ideas for the lens images on the card deck, designed the card layouts, and did graphic design for sev-eral
aspects of the book.
Emma Backer, who performed all the Cinderella
tasks — typesetting the cards, wrangling the card artists, cleaning up and organizing book images,
tracking down copyright holders, and cleaning the
ashes from the fireplace.
The team at Elsevier/Morgan Kaufmann, who kindly let a two-year project take five years: Tim Cox,
Georgia Kennedy, Beth Millett, Paul Gottehrer, Chris
Simpson, Laura Lewin, and Kathryn Spencer. Everyone at the Disney VR Studio who put up with my rambling theoretical non-sense conversations for all those years, especially Mike Goslin, Joe Shochet, Mark Mine, David Rose, Bruce Woodside, Felipe
Lara, Gary Daines, Mk Haley, Daniel Aasheim and
Jan Wallace.
The staff, faculty, and students of Carnegie
Mellon’s Entertainment Technology Center, who graciously let me teach Game Design and Building Virtual Worlds, which forced me to figure all this out.
Most especially Don Marinelli, Randy Pausch,

Hello there! Come in, come in! What a nice surprise — Ihad no idea you would be visiting today. I’m sorry if it is a little messy in here, I’ve been writing. Please —
make yourself comfortable. Good, good. Now let’s see… where should we begin? Oh — Ishould introduce
myself! My name is Jesse Schell, and I have always loved designing games. Here’s picture of me:
Iwas shorter then. Since that picture was taken, I’ve done a lot of different things. I’ve worked in circuses as a professional juggler. I’ve been a writer,
comedian, and magician’s apprentice. I’ve worked at IBM and Bell Communications Research as a software
engineer. I’ve designed and developed interactive theme park rides and massively multiplayer games for the Walt Disney Company. I’ve started my own game studio, and become a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. But when people ask me what I do, Itell them that Iam a game designer.
I mention all this only because at various times
in this book, I will be draw-ing examples from these experiences, since every single one of them has taught me valuable lessons about the art of game design. That might sound surprising now, but hopefully, as you read this book, it will help you see the ways that game design meaningfully connects to the many experiences in your own life.

HELLO
One thing I should clarify — while the goal of this book is primarily to teach you how to be a better videogame designer, many of the principles we
explore will have little to do with videogames specifically — you will find they are more broadly applicable than that. The good news is that much of what you read here will work equally well no matter what kind of game you are designing — digital, analog, or otherwise.
What is Game Design?
As we begin, it is important for us to be absolutely
clear about what is meant by “game design. ” After
all, it is what the whole rest of the book is about, and some people seem a bit confused about it.
Game design is the act of deciding what a game should
be. That’s it. On the surface, it sounds too simple.
“You mean you design a game by just making one decision? ” No. To decide what a game is, you must make
hundreds, usually thousands of decisions. “Don’t I need special equipment to design a
game? ” No. Since game design is simply decision making, you can actually design a game in your head. Usually, though, you will want to write down these decisions, because our memories are weak, and it is easy to miss something important if you don’t write things down. Further, if you want other people to help you make deci-sions, or to help build the game, you need to communicate these decisions to them somehow, and writing them down is a good way to do
that. “What about programming? Don’t game
designers have to be computer programmers? ” No, they don’t. First of all, many games can be played without the use of com-puters or technology; board games, card games, and athletic games, for example. Secondly, even for computer games or
videogames, it is possible to make the deci-sions about what those games should be without knowing all the technical details of how those decisions are carried out. Of course, it can be a tremendous help if you do know these details, just as being a skilled writer or artist can help. This allows you to make better decisions more quickly, but it is not strictly necessary. It is like
the relationship between architects and carpenters : an architect does not need to know everything the carpenter knows, but an architect must know
everything the carpenter is capable of. “So, you mean that the game designer just comes up with the story for the game?” No. Story decisions are one aspect of a game design, but there are many, many others. Decisions
about rules, look and feel, timing, pacing,
risk-taking, rewards, punishments, and everything else the player experiences is the responsibility of the game
designer.
xxiv
WAITING FOR MENDELEEV
“So the game designer makes decisions about what the game should be, writes them down, and moves on? ” Almost never. None of us has a perfect imagination, and the games we design in our heads and on paper almost never come out quite the way we expected. Many decisions are impossible to make until the designer has seen the game in action. For this reason, the designer is usually involved in the development of a game from the very beginning to the very end, making decisions about how the game should be all along the way.
It is important to make the distinction between “game developer ” and “game designer. ” A game developer is anyone who has any involvement with the creation of the game at all. Engineers, animators,
modelers, musicians, writers, producers and designers who work on games are all game developers. Game designers are just one species of game developer. “So, the game designer is the only one allowed
to make decisions about the game?”
Let’s turn that around: Anyone who makes decisions about how the game should be is a game designer. Designer is a role, not a person. Almost
every developer on a team makes some decisions about how the game will be, just through the act of cre-ating content for the game. These decisions are game design decisions, and when you make them, you are a game designer. For this reason, no matter what your role on a game development team, an understanding of the principles of game design will make you better at what you do.
Waiting for Mendeleev
The voyage of discovery is not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes.
— Marcel Proust
The goal of this book is to make you the best game designer you can be. Unfortunately, at present, there is no “unified theory of game design, ” no simple formula that shows us how to make good games. So what can we do? We are in a position something like the ancient
alchemists. In the time before Mendeleev discovered
the periodic table, showing how all the fundamental elements were interrelated, alchemists relied on a
patchwork quilt of rules of thumb about how
different chemicals could combine. These were necessarily incomplete, some-times incorrect, and
often semi-mystical, but by using these rules, the alchemists were able to accomplish surprising things,
and their pursuit of the truth eventually led to modern
chemistry.
Game designers await their Mendeleev. At this point we have no periodic table. We have our own
patchwork of principles and rules, which, less than perfect, allows us to get the job done. I have tried to
gather together the best of these into
xxv
HELLO
one place, so that you can study them, consider them, make use of them, and see how others have
used them. Good game design happens when you view your game from as many perspec-tives as possible. I refer to these perspectives as lenses, because each one is a way of viewing your design. The lenses are small sets of questions you should ask your-self about your design. They are not blueprints or recipes, but tools for examining your design. They will be introduced, one at a time, throughout the book. A deck of cards, with one card summarizing each lens, has been created to accompany this book, and is available at www.artofgamedesign.com, to make it easy to use the lenses while you are designing. None of the lenses are perfect, and none are complete, but each is useful in one context or another, for each gives a unique perspective on your design. The idea is that even though we can’t have one
complete picture, by taking all of these small imperfect lenses and using them to view your problem from many different perspec-tives, you will be able to use your discretion to figure out the best design. I wish we had one all-seeing lens. We don’t. So, instead
of discarding the many imperfect ones we do have, it is wisest to collect and use as wide a variety of them as possible, for as we will see, game design is more art than science, more like cooking than chem-istry, and we must admit the possibility that our Mendeleev will never come.
Focus on Fundamentals
Many people assume that to best study the principles of game design, one would naturally study the most modern, complex, high-tech games that are available. This approach is completely wrong. Videogames are just a natural growth of tradi-tional games into a new medium. The rules that govern them are still the same. An architect must understand how to design a shed before he can design a skyscraper, and so, we will often be studying some of the very simplest games. Some of these will be videogames, but some will be far simpler: Dice games. Card games. Board games. Playground games. If we cannot understand the principles of these games, how can we have a hope of understanding more complex games? Some will argue that these games are old, and therefore not worth studying, but as Thoreau said, “We might as well omit to study
Nature because she is old.” A game is a game is a game. The principles that make the classic games fun are the same principles that make the most modern games fun. The classic games have the added
advantage that they have withstood the tests of time. Their success is not due to the novelty of their technology, which is the case with many modern games. These classic games have deeper qualities that, as game designers, we must learn to understand. As well as a focus on classic games, this book
will strive to deliver the deep-est and most fundamental principles of game design, as opposed to genre-specific principles (“Fifteen tips for a better story-based first-person shooter! ”), because gen-res come and go, but the basic principles of game design are principles of human psychology that have been with us for ages, and will be with us for ages to come.

TALK TO STRANGERS
Well-versed in these fundamentals, you will be able to master any genre that appears, and even invent new genres of your own. As opposed to other books on game design, whose goal often seems to be to cover as much ground as possible, this book will not strive to cover ground, but to teach you to dig in
the most fertile places. And though this book will teach you principles you will be able to use to create traditional board and card games, it is very much slanted toward the videogame industry. Why? Because a game designer’s job is to create new games. The explo-sion of computer technology over the last thirty years has allowed for innovation in the field of game design such as the world has never seen. There are more game designers alive today than have ever been alive in all of human history. Chances are, if you want to create games, you will be creating them somewhere on the cut-ting edge of this new technology, and this book is prepared to show you how to do just that, although the principles here will work just as well with more traditional game genres.
Talk to Strangers
Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some have unwittingly enter-tained angels
— Hebrews 13:2
Game developers have a reputation for xenophobia, that is, fear of strangers. By this I mean
not unfamiliar individuals, but rather unfamiliar techniques, practices, and principles. It almost seems
like they believe that if it didn’t originate in the game industry, it isn’t worth considering. The truth is really that game develop-ers are usually just too
busy to look outside their immediate surroundings. Making good games is hard, so developers keep their
heads down, stay focused, and get the job done. They usually don’t have the time to seek out new
techniques, figure out how to integrate them into their games, and take the risk that a new technique might
fail. So, they play it safe, and stick with what they know, which unfortunately leads to a lot of the “cookie-cutter ” game titles that you see on the market.
But to succeed, to create something great and innovative, you have to do some-thing different. This is
not a book about how to make cookie-cutter games. It is a book about how to create great new designs. If you were surprised by the focus this book places on non-computer games, you will be even more surprised to see how it uses principles, methods, and examples from things that aren’t even games.
Examples from music, architecture, film, science, painting, literature, and everything else under the sun will be pulled in. And why not? Why should we have to develop all our principles from scratch, when hard work has been going on in other fields, sometimes for hundreds or thousands of years? Design principles will come from everywhere because design is everywhere, and design is the same everywhere .
xxvii
HELLO
Not only will this book draw design inspiration from everywhere, it will persuade you to do the same. Everything you know and everything you have experienced is fair game at the game design table.
It does not make much difference what a person studies. All knowledge is related, and the man who
studies anything, if he keeps at it, will become
learned.
— Hypatia
The Map
Game design is not an easy subject to write about. Lenses and fundamentals are useful tools, but to truly understand game design is to understand an
incredibly complex web of creativity, psychology, art,
technology, and business. Everything in this web is connected to everything else. Changing one element affects all the oth-ers, and the understanding of one
element influences the understanding of all of the others. Most experienced designers have built up this web in their minds, slowly, over many years, learning
the elements and relationships by trial and error. And this is what makes game design so hard to write about. Books are necessarily linear. One idea must be presented at a time. For this reason, many game design books have an incomplete feeling to them — like a guided nighttime tour with a flashlight, the reader sees a lot of interesting things, but can’t really
comprehend how they all fit together. Game design is an adventure, and adventure needs a map. For this book, I have created a map that shows the web of game design relationships. You can see the complete map near the end of the book, but to see the entire map at once is confusing and overwhelming. Picasso once said, “To create, one must first destroy. ” And so we will. We set everything aside, and begin our map as a blank slate. As we do this, I encourage you, too, to set aside your preconceptions about game design, so that you can
approach this difficult but fascinating subject with an open mind. Chapter one will begin by adding a single
element, the designer. Successive chapters will add other elements, one at a time, gradually building up
the complex system of relationships between designer, player, game, team, and client, so you can see how they fit together, and why they fit together the way
they do. By the end of the book, you will have, both on paper and in your mind, a map of these relationships. Of course, the map on paper is not the important one — the important one is the one in your mind. And the map is not the territory. It will
necessarily be imper-fect. But hopefully, after this book helps to create a map of relationships in your mind, you will test your mental map against reality, altering it and augmenting it, as you find parts of it that can be improved. Every designer goes through the journey of building their own personal map of these relationships. If you are new to game

WHY I HATE BOOKS
design, this book should be able to give you the beginnings of your map. If you are already a seasoned game designer, I hope that this book can give you some ideas about how to improve the map you have.
Learning to Think
Every truth has four corners: as a teacher I give you one corner, and it is for you to find the other three.
— Confucius
What is Confucius talking about? Shouldn’t a good teacher show you all four corners, laying
everything out plainly? No. To truly learn, remember, and under-stand, your mind must be in a
state of questing, of seeking to find knowledge. If it is not in this state, a state of really wanting to deeply understand, the wisest prin-ciples will roll off you like water off a duck. There will be times in this book
where things will not be laid out plainly — times where things are intentionally less clear so that when you do uncover the truth, it means something to you.
There is another reason for this sometimes cryptic approach. As discussed earlier, game design is not an exact science. It is full of mysteries and
contradic-tions. Our set of lenses will be incomplete and imperfect. To become a great game designer, it is
not enough to be familiar with the set of principles
this book has to offer. You must be ready to think for
yourself, to figure out why certain principles don’t work in certain cases, and to invent new principles of your own. We await our Mendeleev. Perhaps it is you.
Why IHate Books
I hate books, for they only teach people to talk
about what they don’t understand.
— Jean-Jacques Rousseau
It is very important to have a balanced approach to
study and practice.
— The Dalai Lama
Please do not think that reading this book, or any book, will make you into a game designer, much
less a great game designer. Game design is not a set of principles, it is an activity. You could no sooner become a singer, pilot, or bas-ketball player by reading a book than you could become a game designer. There is only one path to becoming a game
designer, and that is the path of designing
xxix
HELLO
games — and more to the point, designing games that people really like. That means that simply jotting down your game idea isn’t enough. You must build the game, play it yourself, and let others play it. When it doesn’t satisfy (and it won’t), you must
change it. And change it. And change it again, dozens of times, until you have created a game that people actually enjoy playing. When you have been through this a few times, then you will start to understand what game design is. There’s an saying among game designers: “Your first ten games will suck — so get them out of the way fast.” The principles in this book will help to guide your designs, and give you useful perspectives on how to make better designs faster, but you can only become a good designer through practice. If you are not really inter-ested in becoming a good game designer, put this book down now. It has nothing for you. But if you truly do want to be a game designer, then this book is not an end, but a beginning —the beginning of a continuous process of study, practice, assimilation, and synthesis that is going to last the rest of your life.
